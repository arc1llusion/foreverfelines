            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p class="story">
                The path to opening Forever Felines was shaped by the unique challenges of the owners. Megan and Jared each battled respective disabilities, but had dreams to be more than their disability and found comfort in their shared love of cats. 
                Determined to create a welcoming space for others like them, they plan to open a cat lounge that also sold quirky, cat-themed merchandise. The lounge offered a peaceful retreat, where visitors could unwind with adoptable cats while browsing everything from cat-shaped mugs to cozy cat-themed blankets.

                Megan designed the lounge to be fully accessible, and used her creativity to curate the merchandise and handle the social media. Together, they built a space that not only showcased their love for cats but also embraced the power of community, resilience, and understanding, proving that disability wasnâ€™t a barrier to turning their dream into reality.
